# EnergyPlus Python Simulation Pipeline

Example usage: 

Run: Using idf and schedule files generated by Restock to Energy Plus pipeline. 
Requires: schedule files in the same folder as the idf files (believe this is due to the IDF schedules not having relative file paths)
From base folder (repostory folder) call the command python eprun_s.py script 

```python eprun_s.py --city not_detroit --year 1992 --climate historical --directory repository directory --ep_install_path EnergyPlus install location of pyenergy plus ```
